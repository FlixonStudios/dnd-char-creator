The following is just a quick walkthrough of how to go about creating your character:

![Image of creator step 1](https://git.generalassemb.ly/chiakaiming/dnd-char-creator/blob/master/src/img/for-readme/char-creator-pt-1.png)

1. First, type the name of your new character!
2. Then use the dropdown menu under "Race", "Class" and "Level" to select your character's race, class and starting level respectively.
3. Don't worry about these for the moment, these are your character's skill proficiencies and are automatically calculated based on your choices later
4. Here you will preview your character portrait. You'll see the default image as a reference for the recommended aspect ratio. If you have the link to your own image, paste it into the input field and hit the "Confirm" button - your image should replace the default image!

Now, onwards to part 2!

5. Don't worry about these stats "Proficiency", "Initiative", "Armor Class" and "Hit Points" these are also automatically calculated
6. Have fun with the Dice! Press the "Roll" button to generate your stats (the smaller number). Depending on the value, these will translate into your Modifiers (which are the bigger numbers just belows each of the STR, DEX etc.). Careful! You can only roll once!
7. Depending on what you selected for your Race and Class, select your starting proficiencies! If you still see a "Select" button, it means you still can choose more proficiencies. Some proficiencies are provided by default, indicated by the "Default" button - you don't need to select them and are just there for you to know. Hit the "Confirm" button when you are done!
8. Note that once you hit the limit for the proficiencies the other buttons will be disabled. Click on the "Selected" button to deselect it and choose another proficiency if you need to.

Just one more push, lets go!!!

9. By now you should see the skill proficiency table update, your selected proficiencies should also be reflected here (applying your proficiency bonus in 5. and the Modifiers in 6. to the final score - Bigger is better! Nothing to do here, lets move on..
10. After clicking "Confirm" in 7. the selections will minimise for your viewing convenience, you can click on these buttons to view/edit your selections. Take note, if you go back and change your Race or Class, you may have to reopen the selections to selects the new proficiencies.
11. Here is a quick reference to your Saving Throws, these are automatic and need no action on your part.
12. As you make your selections in 7., your choices will be summarised here for your ease of reference.
13. Alright, last step, hit that "Save Character" button to lock in your character. Congratulations, you've made your first D&D Character :)
